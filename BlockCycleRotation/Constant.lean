# The constant `C`

Equation (const-c) of Blomer--Bux defines

```
C = ∑_{a > a' ≥ 1, gcd(a,a') = 1}  (2a + a') / (2 a² (a+a')²),
```

an explicit double series over coprime pairs.  Its value is `≈ 0.2125`, and
`D = 1 + 4C ≈ 1.85`.

Note this is a plain convergent series: no integral is involved.  (Theorem 10 of
the paper separately identifies the limit as `∫₀¹ ρ`, but that representation
plays no part in computing `C`.)  Remark 21 rewrites `C` using Euler's
`ζ(2,1) = ζ(3)`; that rewriting is optional.

Convergence is by comparison: for `a' < a` the term is at most `3/(2a³)`, and
summing over the fewer than `a` admissible `a'` leaves `3/(2a²)`.
